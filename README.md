# rise
Minecraft datapack with functions to raise the water/lava levels.

## Installation
First, download this repository as a `.zip` file. Open it, and extract the
`mcrise-master` folder to your save's `datapacks` folder.

## Usage
To initialize borders and start the teleport, run `/function rise:init`. Then,
select one of the helper functions. For example, if you want lava to rise every
10 seconds, run `/function rise:riselava10s`. If you want the level to go down
run `/function rise:lower`, and to stop run `/function rise:stop`.
